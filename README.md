# **Introduction to Threads and Mutexes in the Dining Philosophers Problem**

## **1. Threads: Parallel Execution**
Threads are lightweight processes that allow a program to perform multiple operations **concurrently** within the same memory space. Unlike processes, threads share the same heap memory, file descriptors, and global variables, making communication between them faster but requiring careful synchronization.

### **Key Properties of Threads:**
- **Shared Memory**: All threads in a process can access the same variables.
- **Independent Execution Flow**: Each thread runs its own code segment.
- **Faster Context Switching**: Threads are cheaper to create and switch than processes.
- **Potential Race Conditions**: Since threads share data, uncontrolled access can lead to inconsistencies.

### **Threads in the Dining Philosophers Problem:**
- Each philosopher is represented by a thread (`pthread_t`).
- All philosopher threads run simultaneously, trying to eat, sleep, and think.
- Threads must **synchronize** when accessing shared resources (forks).

---

## **2. Mutexes: Preventing Chaos**
A **mutex (mutual exclusion lock)** ensures that only one thread can access a shared resource at a time. It prevents **race conditions** where multiple threads modify data unpredictably.

### **How Mutexes Work:**
1. **Lock**: A thread acquires a mutex before accessing a shared resource.
   - If locked, other threads **wait** until it‚Äôs released.
2. **Critical Section**: The thread performs operations safely.
3. **Unlock**: The thread releases the mutex, allowing others to proceed.

### **Mutexes in the Dining Philosophers Problem:**
- Each fork is represented by a mutex (`pthread_mutex_t`).
- A philosopher must **lock both adjacent forks** (left and right) to eat.
- If a fork is already taken (locked), the philosopher **waits**.
- Deadlock risk: If all philosophers grab one fork simultaneously, they **freeze** waiting for the second fork.

---

## **3. The Dining Philosophers Challenge**
The problem demonstrates **synchronization issues** in concurrent systems:
- **Deadlock**: All philosophers hold one fork and wait indefinitely.
- **Starvation**: Some philosophers may never get both forks.
- **Race Conditions**: Forks could be accessed by multiple threads at once.

### **Solution Approach in This Project:**
1. **Mutex-Protected Forks**:
   - Each fork is a mutex (`pthread_mutex_t fork`).
   - Philosophers must lock both left & right forks to eat.
2. **Time Constraints**:
   - `ttdie`: Maximum time a philosopher can go without eating.
   - `tteat` / `ttsleep`: Fixed durations for eating and sleeping.
3. **Monitor Thread**:
   - Continuously checks if any philosopher has **starved** (`lastmeal > ttdie`).
   - If so, terminates the simulation.

## **4. Visualizing Thread & Mutex Interaction**

### **Key Takeaways:**
- Threads enable **concurrent execution** but require synchronization.
- Mutexes **prevent race conditions** by enforcing exclusive access.
- The Dining Philosophers problem illustrates **real-world concurrency challenges** (deadlock, starvation).
- This project implements a **deadlock-free solution** using mutexes and monitoring.

```

### Key Interactions Explained:
1. **Main Thread**  
   - Initializes all mutexes (`fork`, `print`, etc.)
   - Spawns N philosopher threads + 1 monitor thread

2. **Philosopher Threads**  
   - Try to lock **left fork** (current index mutex)
   - Try to lock **right fork** (next index mutex)
   - If both acquired:  
     ```
     EAT ‚Üí update last_meal ‚Üí SLEEP ‚Üí THINK
     ```

3. **Monitor Thread**  
   - Continuously checks `last_meal` times
   - If `(current_time - last_meal) > time_to_die`:  
     - Locks `print` mutex
     - Announces death
     - Sets `dead` flag to terminate program

4. **Termination**  
   - Main thread joins all threads
   - Destroys mutexes in reverse initialization order

## üß† The Dining Problem

Simulates philosophers who:
1. Alternate between thinking and eating
2. Must share forks (resources) with neighbors
3. Can starve if they don't eat in time
4. May enter deadlock if improperly synchronized
